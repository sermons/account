# Accountability with Hope
## 1 Thessalonians 3:6-13

>>>
+ Think of s.o. whose **faith** in Chr 
  + you **care** deeply about
+ **Family**, smgp, friend, coworker
+ **Averse** to gospel, open/quest, new believer, or growing
+ Care for their **growth**: not just **wishful** thinking
  + Share God's **love** + Word
  + Follow-up, put faith into **action**

---
<!-- .slide: data-background="white" -->
# How should we <br> hold each other <br> **accountable** in Christ? 
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

>>>
+ Not **logistics**: how freq to meet, or which curric
  + But: with what **attitude**, purpose, mindset
+ Focus on when **we** are resp to hold another acct
+ But like Roman **centurion**: soldiers under him, 
  + and also himself under auth (Mt8:9)
  + Addl layer of appl when on **receiving** end
+ Accountability doesn't have to be **antagonistic**
  + but suffused with **hope** in work of HS
+ Turn to **Scrip**, behold **Lamb** of God

---
(prayer)

>>>
+ **Formed** us, **called** to be your sons+daughters
  + and to walk **worthily** of that calling,
+ Gave us many **promises** as we walk in obedience
  + Planted **faith** in hearts to trust those promises
+ Equip us to **share** that faith w/genuine love
  + to see others **blossom** in faith in You

+ ch3: crux of 1Thes: **report** from Tim's visit
+ 2nd half: addr specific **questions** / issues
+ Ways might **respond** to such an encour. passage:
+ 1. Paul **happy** with Thes: 
  + yes, I love meeting w/friends / smgp
  + check, done, nothing to learn
+ 2. not **realistic**: ppl I deal with
  + aren't as **receptive** as Thes
+ 3. not **achievable**: 
  + Paul was **holy**, I'm not: not **relatable**
+ in ch2, Paul said they had

---
We endeavored the more **eagerly** <br>
and with great **desire** <br>
to see you **face** to face

[1 Thessalonians 2:17 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Not just a **social** visit to see friends
  + but heartfelt **concern** for Thes: 
+ **check** up on their faith in Christ

1. Purpose: Strengthened Faith [v1-5]
1. Product: Joy + Thanksgiving [v6-10]
1. Prayer: Love + Purity [v11-13]

>>>
+ bc Thes had done sth **wrong**? No, rather
+ Paul + Silas preached **gospel** in Thes + other cities
  + so endured intense **persecution**
+ Knew this would **affect** Thes, new in the faith:
  + "Is **this** what following Christ entails?"

---
We sent Timothy ...<br>
to **establish** and **exhort** you in your faith, <br>
[3](# "ref")
that no one be **moved** by these afflictions. 

For you yourselves know <br>
that we are **destined** for this. 

[1 Thessalonians 3:2-3 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **moved**: as dog's **tail** wags unconsciously
  + **swayed** emotionally by external circumstances
+ As child watching **father** break down 
  + under intense **sorrow** / pain:
+ "If even **he** suffers so, what **hope** do I have?"
+ **Suffering** is inherent to Chr life in this age:
+ If proclaim **kingdom** God to world **rejects** auth
  + if **pattern** life after Christ,
+ We should not be **surprised** that we were
  + **laid** / placed into path of suff as Chr
+ Those **watching** us: **trials**, tempt, failures
+ So **compelled** to send Tim to them:

---
I sent to learn about your **faith**, <br>
for **fear** that somehow <br>
the **tempter** had tempted you <br>
and our labor would be in **vain**.

[1 Thessalonians 3:5 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Not "**fear**", but "that not somehow": "lest somehow"
+ Very **real** possib amidst suffering 
  + Satan tries to **probe** our defenses
  + to **poke holes** in shield of faith
+ Tempt to **give up** on following Chr, or
  + get **angry** / bitter, or
  + **compromise**: neglect God's **calling**
  + chase after **desires** of world
+ This **danger** is what moved Paul to send Tim
+ A few things to **notice** about how Paul
  + reached out to Thes to strengthen their faith:

---
1. **Anticipate** Suffering for Christ
1. **Initiate** Support
1. Use **Comfort**, not Coercion

>>>
+ Paul had prior **experience** suffering for Chr
  + knew **more** was coming, and 
  + **told** Thes in advance:

---
For when we were with you, <br>
we kept telling you **beforehand** <br>
that we were to **suffer** affliction, <br>
just as it has come to pass

[1 Thessalonians 3:4 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ not as "I **told** you so", but 
  + for mental **prep**: **stand** firm obey Chr
+ 2. **Init** contact: didn't **wait** for Thes to **ask**
  + pro-actively **sent** support / encour
+ 3. Had auth to **coerce**, but didn't **exert**:
  + **purpose** of sending Tim was

---
We sent Timothy ...<br>
to **establish** and **exhort** you in your faith

[1 Thessalonians 3:2 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Strengthen + **encourage** in the faith
  + **weak**: not more **discip**, work **ethic**
  + but **equip** + **encourage**
+ As **hubby**/dad: bring comfort
+ How I **respond** to suffering/stress
  + affects how **they** react: whether **shaken** or not
+ Would I put on **brave** face, hide?
  + Coldly / stoicly demand they **tough** it out
+ Or use **blame** / guilt: "all bc of you!"
  + Reveal own **irresponsib** / instability
+ Use strength to **comfort**, not coerce

the **good news** of your **faith** and **love** <br>
and reported that you always <br>
**remember** us kindly 

[1 Thessalonians 3:6 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ **Gospel**: proclaim **good** + benef to hearer
+ **Metric** of success: **trust** in God's promises

+ Did not **decrease** even in face of **suffering**
+ A positive **memory** of us, long to **see** us

in all our **distress** and affliction <br>
we have been **comforted** about you <br>
through your faith.

For now we **live**, <br>
if you are **standing** fast in the Lord. 

[1 Thessalonians 3:7-8 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Amid **suffering** on behalf of gospel, **encour**: 
  + **trust** God's prom + **love** one another
+ Our life: **motivation**, defn of success
+ Credit goes to **God**, not us:

---
For what **thanksgiving** can we return to God <br>
for you, for all the **joy** that we feel <br>
for your sake before our God,

[1 Thessalonians 3:9 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Deep-rooted **joy**, not superficial
+ Not contingent on external **circumstances**
  + or performance of **man**
+ But on inexorable **work of HS**
  + according to God's divine **plan**
+ Work is not **over** yet!
  + Continually **growing**:

---
as we **pray** most earnestly night and day <br>
that we may **see** you face to face <br>
and **supply** what is **lacking** in your faith?

[1 Thessalonians 3:9 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Thes' **faith** remained steadfast
  + even though saw **trials** Paul endured
  + that **they** would soon also endure
+ But still had **more** to learn
  + Means more **joy** for Paul+Silas
+ **Equip** + strengthen to face trials
  + **Encourage** in the faith

Now may our God and Father himself, <br>
and our Lord Jesus, **direct our way** to you,

[1 Thessalonians 3:11 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ We don't know where **paths** of life take us
  + But **God** directs them: makes **straight**
+ Earnest **hope** to meet again
  + and when we do, to see that
+ HS has been **working** in hearts in this way:

---
and may the Lord make you **increase and abound** <br>
in **love** for one another and for all, <br>
as we do for you, 

[1 Thessalonians 3:12 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ great in **quantity**, 
  + and even **more**: exceed / overflow
+ not how many Chr **books** read, free **meals** given
  + **hw** done, **house** bought, or **illness** healed
  + even **happy** / trouble-free life
+ What we **pray** for is that they may abound in **love**:
  + **Experience** God's love (what defs love)
  + **Exercise** love to God with all their hearts, and
  + **Exhibit** God's love to all around
+ And as God **fills** them with His love,
  + we have a future **hope**:

---
so that he may establish your hearts **blameless** <br>
in **holiness** before our God and Father, <br>
at the coming of our Lord Jesus <br>
with all his saints.

[1 Thessalonians 3:13 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Chr is **returning** soon: faith made **sight**
  + Books **opened**: all our **deeds** exposed
+ Only by Chr's **grace** we'll be deemed **blameless**
  + HS **strengthens** us to live in holiness
+ Connect to **ch4**: purity + love
+ Always have **hope**: old **SS** far from God
  + other **influences** beyond our control
  + own **decisions**
  + fear **son** may become same
+ But **hope** in God, not men: **pray** may
  + abound in **love**, acc how God loves us
  + strengthen **faith** in God's Word
