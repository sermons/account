+ Accountability doesn't have to be **antagonistic**

+ Turn to **Scrip**, together behold **Lamb** of God
+ Prayer:

______

+ **Formed** us, **called** to be your sons+daughters

+ Gave us many **promises** as we walk in obedience
  + Planted **faith** in hearts to trust those promises
+ Equip us to **share** that faith w/genuine love

1. **Purpose**: to Strengthen Faith <br> *目的*: 增強信心 [(v1-5)](# "ref")
1. **Product**: Joy + Thanksgiving <br> *結果*: 喜樂與感謝 [(v6-10)](# "ref")

+ **Purpose** of sending Tim
+ **Product** / result of acct: bc stand firm
+ **Prayer** for future: **love** abound
+ **Why** send Tim? bc Thes did sth **wrong**? No, rather
+ Paul + Silas preached **gospel** in Thes + other cities
  + and endured intense **persecution** bc of it
+ Knew this would **affect** Thes, new in the faith:
  + "Is **this** what following Christ entails?"
+ This is why:

---
We sent Timothy ...<br>
[3](# "ref")
that no one be **moved** by these afflictions. <br>
For you yourselves know <br>
that we are **destined** for this. 

免得有人被諸般患難搖動。<br>
因為你們自己知道<br>
我們受患難原是命定的。

[1 Thessalonians 帖撒羅尼迦前書 3:3 (ESV/CUV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "**moved**": as dog's **tail** wags unconsciously
  + **swayed** emotionally by external circumstances
+ As child watching **father** (role model) break down 
  + under intense **sorrow** / pain:
+ "If even **he** suffers so, what **hope** do I have?"
+ **Suffering** is inherent to Chr life in this age:
+ If proclaim **kingdom** God to world **rejects** His auth,
  + if we **pattern** life after Christ,
+ We should not be **surprised** that we are
  + **laid** / placed into path of suff as Chr
+ Those **watching** us observ **trials**, tempt, failures
+ So **compelled** to send Tim to them:

---
I sent to learn about your **faith**, <br>
for **fear** that somehow <br>
the **tempter** had tempted you <br>
and our labor would be in **vain**.

為此，我既不能再忍，就打發人去，<br>
要曉得你們的信心如何，<br>
恐怕那誘惑人的到底誘惑了你們，<br>
叫我們的勞苦歸於徒然。

[1 Thessalonians 帖撒羅尼迦前書 3:5 (ESV/CUV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Not "**fear**", but "that not somehow": "lest somehow"
+ Very **real** possib: amidst suffering 
  + Satan tries to **probe** our defenses
  + to **poke holes** in shield of faith
+ Tempt to **give up** on following Chr, or
  + get **angry** / bitter, or
  + **compromise**: neglect God's **calling**
  + chase after **desires** of world
+ **We** are suscep, so are those we **care** for
+ This **danger** is what moved Paul to send Tim
+ A few things to **notice** about how Paul
  + reached out to Thes to strengthen their faith:

---
## 1. Strengthen Faith 增強信心 [(v1-5)](# "ref")
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

+ A. **Anticipate** Challenges 預料挑戰
+ B. **Initiate** Support 起頭支持
+ C. Radiate **Comfort**, not Coercion <br>
  安慰，不是脅迫

<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

>>>
+ Paul had prior **experience** suffering for Chr
+ knew **more** was coming, and 
+ **told** Thes in advance:

---
For when we were with you, <br>
we kept telling you **beforehand** <br>
that we were to **suffer** affliction, <br>
just as it has come to pass

我們在你們那裡的時候，<br>
預先告訴你們，我們必受患難，<br>
以後果然應驗了，你們也知道。

[1 Thessalonians 帖撒羅尼迦前書 3:4 (ESV/CUV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ not as "I **told** you so", but 
  + for mental **prep**: to **stand** firm in obey Chr
+ (2) **Initiate** contact: 
  + didn't **wait** for Thes to **ask** for help
  + but pro-actively **sent** support / encour
+ (3) Had auth to **coerce**, but didn't **exercise**:
  + **purpose** of sending Tim was

---
We sent Timothy ...<br>
to **establish** and **exhort** you in your faith

打發 ... 提摩太前去，堅固你們，<br>
並在你們所信的道上勸慰你們，

[1 Thessalonians 帖撒羅尼迦前書 3:2 (ESV/CUV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ "Establish": **strengthen**, make firm
  + when **weak**: need not more **discip**, work **ethic**
  + but us to **equip**, supply, give strength
+ e.g., teaching **SS**: frustrated at **immaturity**
  + still **growing**: your **task** to teach, show
+ "Exhort" (**enc**): as **hubby**/dad: bring **comfort**
+ How I **respond** to suffering/stress
  + affects how **they** react: whether **shaken** or not
+ Do I put on **brave** face, hide pain?
  + Coldly / stoicly demand they **tough** it out
+ Or use **blame** / guilt: "all bc of you!"
  + Revealing own **irresponsib** / insecurity
+ Use strength not to coerce, but to **comfort**

>>>
+ **Exert** auth, demand **respect**, or instill **fear**?
  + "I **suffered** unjust auth, now you must, too"
+ Instead, drawing **strength** from
  + **faithfulness** of God's Word,
+ **Anticipate** opposition as walk in Chr steps
+ **Initiate** support to help stand **firm**
+ Radiate **comfort**, not coercion
  + **encourage**: call alongside, 
  + walk togeth on **narrow** path leads to life
+ So see how **suffering** can **strengthen** our faith
