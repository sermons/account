For you yourselves know <br>
that we are destined for this.

For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, <br>
I sent to learn about your faith, <br>
for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you <br>
and our labor would be in vain.

remember us kindly and long to see us, <br>
as we long to see you

in all our distress and affliction <br>
we have been comforted about you <br>

For what thanksgiving can we return to God <br>
for you, for all the joy that we feel <br>
for your sake before our God,

as we pray most earnestly night and day <br>
that we may see you face to face <br>
and supply what is lacking in your faith?

Now may our God and Father himself, <br>
and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you,

in love for one another and for all, <br>
as we do for you, 

[1 Thessalonians 3:11-12 (ESV)](# "ref")

so that he may establish your hearts blameless <br>
in holiness before our God and Father, <br>
at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
